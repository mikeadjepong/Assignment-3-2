a. Using Standard Normal Distribution Z=(Shift-Mean)/Standard deviation, so (6.2-6.0)/1. The likelihood that his head breadth is 6.2inches is 0.2
b. 
c.
Using Z test because the sample size is greater than 30. Xbar= 14.6kg mu0= 15.4(kg Standard Dev= 2.5 and my sample size is 35. Z =(xbar-mu0)/(Standard Dev/sqrt(sample size). Z = -1.351
-1.351 falls within 2 standard deviation so T significance level of 0.5 we can not reject the null hypothesis that mean penguin weight does not differ from last year
